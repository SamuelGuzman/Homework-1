   ...and summary:
```{r second_chunk}
summary(quakes)
```
2. Show the entirity of the column long.
```{r third_chunk}
quakes[ , "long"]
```
3. Try using the function unique() applied to a vector.
```{r fourth_chunk}
my_vec <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4)
unique(my_vec)
```
What unique stations are there?
```{r fifth_chunk}
unique(quakes[ , "stations"])
```
Use length() with unique() to determine how many stations there are.
```{r sixth_chunk}
length(unique(quakes[ , "stations"]))
```
4. Using range()what is the range of depths where quakes occur?
```{r seventh_chunk}
range(quakes[ , "depth"])
```
